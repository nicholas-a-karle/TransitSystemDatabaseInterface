# Hypothetical Pomona Transit System Database Interface

This is a hypothetical implementation of a rough draft of a transit system. The name Pomona is used arbitrarily, nothing about anything here has anything to do with the city of Pomona.

Assuming your mysql is hosted at jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306 with the username root and password 1234, this will work
Otherwise you will encounter errors.

If so, edit the source code, this program does not prompt for host, username, or password

It also randomly generates data, so editing the source code is also the only way to toggle that as of now
